# whiteboard parser
Reads a picture of a whiteboard with a grid on it and parses the the symbol in the cells. It returns a gathered_data.csv. Each row has an array of pixel values and the last element of the row has the class. (same format as the mnist dataset, which I inted to append this data too)
